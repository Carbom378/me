<h2>Few things about my previous work experience;</h2>
<ul>
	<li>My first job was handing out flyers when I was 11.</li> 
	<li>Then me and my family were running a charity foundation for dogs for about 3 years.</li>
		<li>When I was 15 I have been working at a zoo where I was taking care of parrots, that is also where I first started to learn how to work with people.</li> 
		<li>Around the same time I started working as my own boss and was giving private tutore English lessons for people around my age who were struggling with communicating in this language and passing exams. This lasted for about 3 years during school months.</li>
		<li>In my 2nd year of high school I was at an internship at a logistician/freightforwarding company where I worked side by side with proffesionals and helped them with everything they were doing from talking with clients to using ordering software.</li> 
        <li>I am also really passionate about clothes and shoes, that is why I started to sell them online. This lasted for about 2 years and now I consider it as my hobby and still do it on the side.</li> 
		<li>From June 2020 to September 2021 I was working at a casino as a waiter/barman. At this place I got to work with higher class people from all around the world and learned how to work under pressure, improved my skills at waitering, bartending and overall working with people.</li>
		<li>I was also working at a VIP/business lounge at National stadium in Warsaw during UEFA World Cup Qualifications games where I was taking care of clients in VIP rooms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Now few things about me!</h2>
<p>My name is Wiktor Szelenbaum. I was borned in Warsaw, Poland and I lived there for the first 20 years of my life. I recently decided to pursue one of my biggets dreams which is travelling and that is why moved completely on my own to Barcelona, Spain. I love travelling because you can meet people from all around the world, explore new cultures, standards and discover the world from a completely new perspective <a href="https://map1.maploco.com/visited-countries/mine.php?c1=m67ic67yf4-b4nop5sx6o-b3ajtx2sjk-b33j9zwr28-2s5wxeic5c" target="_blank" title="map">(Countries I've visited)</a>. I also love getting out of my comfort zone and trying new things. I hate sitting around and doing nothing that is also why I have many passions and I try to do as many as I can on a daily baisis. Few of those passions are: learning languages, running, reading, exercising, programming (I made this site completely on my own from scratch), playing guitar or cooking. In my spare time I usually do one of those passions listed above, go for a walk with music playing in my headphones or when I am completely exhausted just lay in my bed and watch a movie or a TV series.
